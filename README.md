🐾 Python Programming Assignments (Vaultof Codes Internship)

This repository contains my completed assignments from the Vaultof Codes internship, demonstrating fundamental skills in Python development and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

1. Virtual Pet Simulator (Assignment Highlight)

This project is a command-line simulation that tests the ability to manage complex, dynamic state variables and conditional logic within a structured Python class.

🎯 Goal

To build a pet simulator where the pet's Hunger and Happiness levels are interdependent and change based on user actions and the constant passage of time.

✨ Key Features Implemented

Object-Oriented Design: All pet state and logic is encapsulated within the VirtualPet class.

Interdependent Logic: Actions like feed() and play() adhere to specific rules (e.g., Playing increases Happiness but slightly increases Hunger).

Time Decay: An automatic decay system (_time_passes()) ensures Hunger gradually increases and Happiness decreases, requiring constant maintenance.

Critical Conditions: Implemented the required High Hunger Penalty (Hunger > 80 severely penalizes Happiness) and robust Game Over checks.

🛠 Technology Used

Language: Python 3.x

Concepts: OOP, Class Methods, Conditional Logic, State Management, User Input Handling.

2. Getting Started

Prerequisites

You need Python 3 installed on your system.

Running the Simulator

Clone the Repository (Optional, if using Git):

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd VaultofCodes-Assignments/VirtualPetSimulator


OR simply download the virtual_pet_simulator.py file.

Execute the Script:

python virtual_pet_simulator.py


Interact: Follow the on-screen menu (Feed, Play, Check Status) to keep your pet, lucky, alive!
